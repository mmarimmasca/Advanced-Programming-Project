## Main aim
<!-- what is the aim of the software, what it does, in very general terms -->
## The gff3 file
The data on which the software works is stored in a GFF3 file, which stands for Generic Feature Format Version 3, called 'Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.85.gff3'. This file contains the annotation of the sequences.
The file can be downloaded here : [link to...]()

GFF3 files are nine-column, tab-delimited, plain text files; they're actually conceived as tabular data. In the head of the file is usually present many metadata lines which start with:
- \## (meaning it's stable metadata)
- #! (meaning experimental metadata)
- \###
- \# (for human readable comments)

All these metadata have to be ignored and removed from the file for its analysis.
*In the next section it will be described how and where.*

Also, for each line, the empty columns are denoted with a '.' .

The nine columns, also called fields, are the following: seqid, source, type, start, end, score, strand, phase, attribute (which contains a list of seven features in the form tag=value separated by semicolumns).

## Data access
In order to work and deal with the annotation data, the GFF3 file is transformed into a DataFrame object of Pandas (a Python library for dealing with tabular data).
For the realization of this purpose, the class **Reader_gff3** behaves as a dataset reader which takes the dataset in GFF3 format and creates a correspondant Pandas DataFrame. This one is actually returned by the Reader_gff3 function as an instance of the class Dataset_gff3.
The Reader_gff3 class is a subclass of the abstract class *Reader*, which is a general abstract interface.

The Reader_gff3 class takes as input the Pandas DataFrame corresponding to the original GFF3 file and returns an instance of the Dataset_gff3 class. The class **Dataset_gff3** is a subclass of the **Dataset** class: the first one is peculiar for the GFF3 case; whereas the second one is a class defining a generic tabular data. The Dataset_gff3 class also takes as input a Pandas DataFrame (that derives from the GFF3 file) and modifies it to make it properly structured for the obtaining of the insights over data.

The modifications we have applied to the DataFrame are:
- removal of all the metadata
- replacement of the missing values (labeled with '.') with NaN values

The Pandas DataFrame resulting from Dataset_gff3 becomes an instance of its superclass Dataset.
Then the Dataset object corresponding to the cleaned GFF3 file can be used to get the insights from the annotation file.


## Dataset operations
The software allows to get a number of insights over the annotation data. These are:
1. Information about columns : get the basic information about the dataset
2. List seqIDs : obtain the list of unique sequence IDs available in the dataset
3. List of types : obtain the list of unique type of operations available in the dataset
4. Count features in 'source' : count the number of features provided by the same source
5. Count entries in 'type' : count the number of entries for each type of operation
6. Information about entire chromosomes : derive a new dataset containing only the information about entire chromosomes
7. Calculate the fraction of unassembled sequences : calculate the fraction of unassembled sequences from source GRCh38
8. Display entries from 'havana', 'ensembl', 'ensembl_havana' : obtain a new dataset containing only entries from source 'ensembl', 'havana' and 'ensembl_havana'
9. Count entries from new_havana : count the number of entries for each type of operation for the dataset containing containing only entries from source 'ensembl', 'havana' and 'ensembl_havana'
10. Genes names : return the gene names from the dataset containing containing only entries from source 'ensembl', 'havana' and 'ensembl_havana'

These insights, also referred to as 'operations', are contained in a registry of active operations.

## User interface
The software can be accessed by users through a web page, supported on Flask.
The homepage presents briefly the software and from there the registry of active operations and the project document can be accessed.
The registry of active operations opens in another page view where all the possible operations are listed and by selecting one of them another page view is opened where the result is displayed.
  For some of the operations ("List seqIDs", "Information about entire chromosomes", "Display entries from 'havana', 'ensembl', 'ensembl_havana'", "Genes names") the resulting dataset displayed is a preview of the complete one containing only the *first 10 and last 10* rows; the real one can be accessed from the same page view.
The project document page view displays the description of the project in terms of software analysis, design and implementation, including CRC cards and UML class diagrams and their description.
