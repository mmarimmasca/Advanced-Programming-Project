## Data access
<!-- describe how the reader works (Reader and Reader_gff3) and what they return,
so then describe the dataset classes (Dataset and Dataset_gff3) and then what they return, for what they're needed, how they work and how they're linked to the reader classes -->
## Dataset operations
<!-- what are these, how they work (what are the input and the output), describe briefly what each of them do -->
